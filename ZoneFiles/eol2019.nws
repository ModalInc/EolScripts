Welcome to Twip Peaks IRPG!

This zone, as with any new zone, will have some kinks that need be worked out.  Nothing you see here is set
in stone, so please be patient.  Things will be adjusted as time allows.

Please report any map errors/bugs on the forums.

This is using Minac/Bomb's last known files for Eol Advanced[2010] and Burnt's altered TP map
Starting cash is set to 200k and attributes are cheaper than they were on SOE

Pies + Bots coming soon

Getting Started

What is this?

Infantry RPG is a game zone where players collect cash and experience to customise their player character.  Players can also form teams and control areas of the map, the more organised and successful the team, the more cash and experience they will get. This version is a continuation of Eol.



~BCash~B

Cash is gained by capturing and retaining Major Resource Points and by defeating Aliens, Pirates or Hive Spiders. When players or Aliens/Pirates/Spiders are defeated they will drop prizes such as gems, credits or helmets. Picking these items up will give cash.


~BExperience~B

-Experience is gained by defeating enemy players, Enemy Pirates, Aliens and Hive Spiders.  Major Resource Points will also
  give Experience rewards.

-Experience is used to purchase attributes.

Current ~BExperience~B level affects current rank.
