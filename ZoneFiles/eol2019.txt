~B~2I:RPG Eol Pioneer Station~2~B
~BIRPG Alpha~B

Welcome to Eol Pioneer Station IRPG!

This zone, as with any new zone, will have some kinks that need be worked out.  Nothing you see here is set
in stone, so please be patient.  Things will be adjusted as time allows.

Please report any map errors/bugs on the discord.

This is Eol Advanced[2010] with an adapted Eol Crater map.
Starting cash is set to 35k. You start with some Conscript armor, with further conscript armor able to be purchased. You also start with a store recall, Pistol and Carbine.

~B~2There are many aspects new and old to do in Eol Pioneer Station.~2~B

Sectors: Due to Radiation winds that now cover the planet, certain areas of the map will at times be out of bounds. Going outside the marked area on the map, will result in rapid loss of health.
The map is now split up into 4 sectors. A, B, C, D. Top left sector is Sector A, Bottom left sector is Sector B, top right sector is Sector C and bottom right is Sector D.
A single sector will open upon game start when there are under 30 players. Two adjoining sectors will open upon the next start if over 30 but below 60. 
If over 80 then all 4 sectors will be opened, allowing the entire map to be roamed. The sector changes come on the automatic game restarts that come every 12 hours 
(Unless a Koth game is in progress, then it will wait until that has ended)

Btying: The old classic 30k team btying is very much possible. Either be the btyer or hunt the btyer.

KOTH: Starting at 10 players. 3 lives, last man standing wins.

HQ: Build a HQ, receive bty points and use them to level up your HQ. Build a base around it. Gaining points and experience the longer your HQ stands. You can also gain Points and experience by attacking and destroying other team's HQ's. These can be built by engineers. They cost 5000 for the kit(3500 sale price) and use 20 Titanium Alloy to make a HQ.

Bot Bases: These are bases setup by bots with their own HQ. You can attack these to gain rewards just like attacking another player teams HQ.

Flagging: Capture flags to earn points and experience for holding these every 300 seconds. The more you hold, the more you earn. Building bases around flags is common, so ensure the flag remains in your teams hands.

Roaming Bot teams: When flags are captured, Pioneer Station will send down Roaming Flag Captains who with a team for 10 attackers, roam from flag to flag attacking all those in their way.

New map layout, extensive work has been done to the map to allow for population dependant play.

The map is segregated into 4 sectors. 
When the population is below 30 only 1 sector will be opened at random. If the population surpasses 30 but lower than 60 players then another sector will open, making two ajoining sectors open together.
Should the population surpass 60 players, all sectors will open. If you step into a closed sector you will lose health at a rapid rate and could ultimately die.

Added in a flagging points game. First team to 10000 accumilated flagging points win that game. The flags will then reset and can be recaptured to start again.

Teams: Sizes are limited per population. Under 30, 6 Players per team. 30 to 60, 8 players per team. Over 60 10 players
